A simple test of Git skillz. 

The time is late, and I keep editing myself; it's not only a time-waster, but is overly enervating at this hour! Should I write HTML or AsciiDoc here? That is the question, and one I may not answer correctly (or to have queried at all.) I'm not working in Atlas right now, and that's an disorienting thing...but kind of exciting, too. 

Hello Dan and everyone else who will be evaluating this. I hope you're Thanksgiving was thoughtful, nice, safe, and trouble-free (to your standards and tolerances!) Matt H. made sure those in the office today had a good lunch, so I'm thankful the holiday began on a convival note for everyone in the ORM Boston office. And I'm grateful for this opportunity to have assisted the O'Reilly production editors these past weeks in facilitating their end-of-year schedules, hopefully serving them well and to their expectations (the one awful exception being a certain _MPLS in the NDS Era_ draft manuscript. I hope I've not cost Chris and Nicole too much time in correcting the ID replacements I made in HTML.) They deserve everyone's best efforts. This is my first experience working in html and asciidoc, and I truly appreciate the opportunity. The time is long past to begin learn working in and with markup and 'markdown' languages: specializations in our industry aside (and I do hold my nose up high at the productionâ€”editorial divide) _how_ content is trascribed, produced, and made available to all readers and learners is the purview of every publishing professional. 

Well, I'm going the preview my changes, see what this text space looks like, and go from there. If writing in a language was expected, I will choose AsciiDoc.

Sincerely,
Gretchen
