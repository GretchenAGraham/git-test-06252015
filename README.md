# git-test-06252015
A simple test of Git skillz. 

The time is late, and I keep editing myself; it's not only a time waster, but is overly enervating at this hour! Should I write HTML or AsciiDoc here? My punctuation will be in AsciiDoc. I'm not working in Atlas right now, and that's an disorienting thing...but kind of exciting, too. 

Hello Dan and everyone else who will be evaluating this. 

I hope your Thanksgiving was thoughtful, nicely interesting, safe, and trouble-free (to your standards and tolerances!) Matt H. made sure those in the office today had a good lunch, so I'm thankful the holiday began on a convivial note for everyone in the ORM Boston office. And I'm grateful for this opportunity to have assisted the O'Reilly production editors these past weeks in facilitating their end-of-year schedules, hopefully serving them well and to their expectations. They deserve everyone's best efforts. (The one awful exception—expectation-wise, for me—is a certain _MPLS in the NDS Era_ draft manuscript. I hope I've not cost Chris and Nicole much time in correcting the #ID replacements I made in HTML. That experience was a lesson in honouring my 'second-guess' voice as well as not being embarrassed to ask the prod ed a question about making a "simple" HTML edit that I had little experiece in making.)

This temp assignment is my first real-world experience working in html and asciidoc, and I truly appreciate the opportunity. The time is long past for me to begin learn working in and with markup and 'markdown' languages: specializations in our industry aside (and I do hold my nose up high at the production—editorial divide) _how_ content is transcribed, produced, and made available to all readers and learners is the purview of every publishing professional. ORM has long been considered a leader in technical publishing. Apprenticeship in your company is coveted (just ask any former employee and their current employer: I'm friends with two former employees, and with one current writer, and consider myself lucky.) Enough about me. How may I serve you?

Well, I'm going the preview my changes, see what this text space looks like, and go from there. If writing in a language was expected, I will choose AsciiDoc.

Edit: finding my way back to my branch/live copy was not fun (as this is a test) and promising too much is not alright! I spotted typos; and am reviewing the "Using Pull Requests" directions. Hopefully, I complete this exercise honourably. 

Sincerely,
Gretchen

p.s. ORM and GitHub should collaborate on an Octocat engraving and temporary tattoo patch.
